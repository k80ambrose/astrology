        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Astrology is a symbolic language. Knowledge of these symbols and what they represent is often considered a prerequisite to practicing astrology. The information above could be represented by a <a href="https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/current-planets-astrology-transits-planetary-positions">natal chart</a>, but this representation is illegible to those unacquainted with Astrology’s symbolic vocabulary. Recognizing this barrier, I created this site to bridge the gap between seasoned astrologers and any individual interested in keeping up to date with planetary transits.<br><br>
            If you are interested in learning Astrology's symbolic language, here's a few resources:<br><br>
            1. <a href="https://astrolibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/Symbols-PlanetsSigns.pdf">Diagram of Astrological Glyphs</a> Start with the signs and planets symbols first and then move on to aspect and asteroids later.<br>
            2. <a href="https://astrolibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/Symbols-PlanetsSigns.pdf">Aspect Glyphs</a></p>
