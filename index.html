            <p>Astrology is a symbolic language. Knowledge of these symbols and what they represent is often considered a prerequisite to practicing astrology. The information above could be represented by a <a href="https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/current-planets-astrology-transits-planetary-positions">natal chart</a>, but this representation is illegible to those unacquainted with Astrology’s symbolic vocabulary. Recognizing this barrier, I created this site to bridge the gap between seasoned astrologers and any individual interested in keeping up to date with planetary transits.</p>
