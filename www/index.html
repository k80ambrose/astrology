            <p>Astrology is a symbolic language. The 12 zodiacal signs, as well as the planets, asteroids, and the angles formed between them, are all represented with unique glyphs that comprise astrology's alphabet. Knowledge of these symbols and what they represent is often considered a prerequisite to practicing astrology.<br><br>For example, the information above is most commonly represented by a <a href="https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/current-planets-astrology-transits-planetary-positions">natal chart</a>, specifically, a chart of the moment. Although this representation contains a lot more information than this site does, it is illegible to the general public. Recognizing this barrier, I created this site to bridge the gap between seasoned astrologers and any individual interested in keeping up to date with planetary transits.<br><br>
