        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Astrology is a symbolic language. Planets, asteroids, and the angles they form, as well as the 12 zodiacal signs are each represented with the unique glyphs that comprise astrology's alphabet. Knowledge of these symbols and what they represent is often considered a prerequisite to practicing astrology.<br><br>For example, the information above is commonly represented by a <a href="https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/current-planets-astrology-transits-planetary-positions">natal chart</a>, specifically, a chart of the moment. This representation is illegible to the general public. Recognizing this barrier, I created this site to bridge the gap between seasoned astrologers and any individual interested in keeping up to date with planetary transits.<br><br>
            If you are interested in learning astrology's symbolic language, here's a few resources:<br><br>
